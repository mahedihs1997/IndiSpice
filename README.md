I created this program while I was in college and it was my first program. I created the program using .Net.

The program allows you to create a new user to log into the system. There is no database to store the data, so details are reset everytrime.

The program allows you to select foods and quantity. Then it will automatically calcualte how much the total will be.

There is an option to add discount, and it also takes into account VAT. 

You can create an invoice for the items that you bought at the end.
